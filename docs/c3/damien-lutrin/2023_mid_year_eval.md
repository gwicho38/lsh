Ever since starting in June of 2023, Damien has enthusiastically jumped into project work. Damien has already made significant contributions to DLA, DINOE, and SCLERA despite joining less than six months ago. He particularly demonstrated his eagerness to both learn and contribute by volunteering to support a SCLERA demo application on short notice which required long hours around Labor Day weekend.

As Damien continues to grow at C3, I hope to see the following from Damien over the next 6 months:

1. Deepen his technical understanding of C3's platform. Damien is naturally curious to solve the impossible, and has dove deep into the technical weeds already. He should dive even further and not be afraid to reach out for help from his more experienced peers.
2. Participate more with the broader C3 community. Damien has contributed to the community by creating a tool that automatically refreshes a user's console after provisioning in V7, but he can do more to participate in Community, Office Hours, and Lunch & Learns. By the end of the fiscal year, I would like to see Damien become a resource for other engineers on the team.
3. Grow into a project leadership role. Damien is still relatively new at C3 since joining us in June, but he already shows potential as a project lead. He should find opportunities to take on more responsibility while he works on DINOE so that by the end of the upcoming fiscal year he is ready to lead projects. While it is early to set that expectation, I believe Damien has the potential to reach it.

Damien is naturally hard-working, curious, and motivated. While there are opportunities for growth, I have no doubt Damien will meet and exceed the expectations we are placing upon him. I'm excited to see his development over the remainder of the fiscal year.
