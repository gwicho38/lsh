## 20231025

Field opps work. {@peter} and {@manas} got v8 working on SuiteCase. Test Azure installation guide + terraform. Test the guide to see if there's anything to be added.

In one of two months would like to move. 

Two lead a project. Prefer back end Dev Work. 

Data Modeling work. 

`CDAO` still open to that type of work. 

Open to genAi Pilot. 

ML Opps Orchestration. `MLE` / `MLO` would be a really nice spot to learn  with.
