#todo

### DCSA 

@TRANSCOM 

100% on DCSA now. DCSA is going really well. @Torch also has a contract with @c3 . @Torch has a data store management. 

Goal to demonstrate value to DCSA customer. 

Data synthesis approach - to propagate data with their model. 

@v8 migration details were ironed out. 

@aws 

	> 20-30% meetings
	> remainder --> 50% opps
	> 50% dev
	> backend 

customer interactive
aws management 
system design

anything beyond May/June. 

#todo 

@objectives 
## 20231025

Field opps work. {@peter} and {@manas} got v8 working on SuiteCase. Test Azure installation guide + terraform. Test the guide to see if there's anything to be added. 

> Preferences for Next Assignment

In one of two months would like to move. 

Two lead a project. Prefer back end Dev Work. 

Data Modeling work. 

`CDAO` still open to that type of work. 

Open to genAi Pilot. 

ML Opps Orchestration. `MLE` / `MLO` would be a really nice spot to learn  with.
