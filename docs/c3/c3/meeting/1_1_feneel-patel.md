#star NIPR and SIPR

#uiuc Naresh or Adi was denied. Was told that he didn't have enough C3 contributions. 

`short term`:  liked meeting with clients + liked managing the project at a higher level. Enjoyed working with solution manager. Tickets that help him grow, work on tools that are current. Learning nuances of platform. Wants a promotion at the end of the year. 

`long term`: wanting to move away from configuration style work.  

`v8` development: ok -- not keen on it. 

`SIPR` space ingestion will happen tomorrow. 

Once the data is in. Has created backlog tickets for the RDIM project. `Shrei` as solution manager, 30 minute to go through the backlog. Explain where it was in phase

Data Veracity integration should be good.
