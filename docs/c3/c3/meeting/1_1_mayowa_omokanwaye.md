Iowa with an `M`

Was working freelance. She's done well. She was a teacher before. She joined flex. Then she's worked RSO. She's where she's supposed to as an associate engineer. 

Luke likes her. 

She's hitting the tech stack. She has UI experience during the training rotation. 

She is now shifting back to UI. 

What's next?
