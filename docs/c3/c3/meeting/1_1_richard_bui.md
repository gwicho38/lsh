### None of it 

### Jan 8, 2024-Jan 19, 2024 - Biweekly Recap

- Completed several jasmine testing tickets
    
- Gained some exposure to Data Science as I was tasked with migrating an AMS-web scrape script from R to Python using a Conda environment
    

- Used Selenium to open up a new browser and navigate through links to parse html elements
    

- Peer-programmed with some of the contractors to help them with their tickets
    
- Reached out for resources on V8 Deployments in order to prepare ahead of time (expected to start EOM)
    
- Finished the Introduction to Cyber Security Coursera Course
    
- Started working on the Intel apps effort ICM
    

- Originally tasked with integrating external Library APIS but am blocked by the govt (have not set up their endpoint) so working on other features  
      

Project Status:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Project|Due Date|Roadblockers / Next Steps|
|SOCOM<br><br>(Commanderâ€™s Dashboard)|Delivery Date of Mid March|- DM has been out until 1/11 so there is some delay on getting our new design screens<br>    <br>- DM leaving company, so the new DM will be the 3rd one on this project<br>    <br>- Need to get ATO approval in order to have our V8 application deployed on NIPR|
|ICM<br><br>(Information Collection Module)|Demo end of January|- First time developing in V8 and this project uses basic react instead of SDL components, so a bit of a learning curve|
