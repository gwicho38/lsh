    Conf-4.9-W-Menlo Park
    
    And you know, there are a number of pilots in cdao, a number of services engagements now that have come over from solutions and the work that we're doing there has a lot of inner dependency and relationships to a number of the core product capabilities we want to deliver.

    Conf-4.9-W-Menlo Park
    
    Primarily, we're gonna be making a change to to the federal organization and really carving out CDAO into its own team, its own verticalized team.

    Conf-4.9-W-Menlo Park
    
    Uh, and and this is similar to what you heard this morning from Binu and Adrian and talking about some of the changes that we're making to the reliability and sustainability work that we do.

    Conf-4.9-W-Menlo Park
    
    Uh, as well as the state and local work that we do bringing together, you know, products, engineering, QA, etcetera into a centralized team led by a general manager in the federal space that's going to be fill the difference here in the work that we're doing here and the approach that we're taking is that we're also going to be bringing solutions and services solutions, solutions, engineering and services rather into this verticalized team to help us ensure success across our CDAO projects, but also to use CDAO really as an excelerator to help us deliver these, these, you know, an initial set of prioritized core product capabilities.

    Conf-4.9-W-Menlo Park
    
    Umm, So what this means is that effective this week we are going to be bringing together under Phil a number of solution managers to help drive the the CDAO work that's going on on the pilot side, a number of delivery managers.

**This this is is just a way for us to provide some focused and integrated focus on CDAO and on core product delivery within within this team.** 

CDAO + product team

"natural variations"?

is base delivering this rate?

## Questions

do we have a path to getting deployments delivered?

where in the development-deployment pipeline do we think we can scale?

	-> is it per environment?

	-> per CoE?

shims?
