## YSK for Reports

> [!NOTE] Added to IT Support Staff List?
> 
> Sometime between Oct 17th, 2022 and February 27th, 2023, IT Support stopped adding new employees (or at least my newest team members) to the `C3 Staff` distribution list. Because of this, Parvesh, Ben, and Brendan did not receive email notifications about stock trading blackout windows and probably some other important information. I plan on submitting an IT ticket on behalf of them to get them added to the distro list.

> [!NOTE]  Partner Engineer Concerns.If partnership engineer concerns:
	1) invest more coaching for next sprint
	2) alert the services PoC where they get 2 more weeks to ramp up support
