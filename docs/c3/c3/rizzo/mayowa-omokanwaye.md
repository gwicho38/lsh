## TODO

- [ ] Hi Luis, I was wondering about how to try again to get an ECA for logging on to RSO environments. Last time when I/Micheal tried to request and escalate approval for am ECA card, he never heard back about approval. But this past week, not having it is becoming a blocker on my ability to help out with certain work on the RSO team. I still haven't heard anything further about Security Clearance (in order to get my CAC card) but I was wondering if I could try again to get expense approval for an ECA in the meantime?⏫ ➕ 2023-11-15 ⏳ 2023-11-15  [link](https://todoist.com/showTask?id=7476034818) #todoist %%[todoist_id:: 7476034818]%%
