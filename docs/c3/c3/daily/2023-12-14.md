	Cesium Ion self-hosted

- Can we include base CesiumJS as a library as part of our runtime? 

	> Yes. 
	> 
	> 	c3 ui runs from a NodeJS environment. We tested cesium libraries against c3 libraries and were able to run a cesium application without any dependency conflicts.
	
	 List of c3 packages with an approved version on swaplist:

		![[Pasted image 20231214115218.png]]

    - Does the globe visualization fit within our native UI framework or needs to be an iframe?

	 > Generally yes, we can import and use a CesiumGlobe component into our existing framework. 

    - If cesium is included, perhaps addl compute resources should be considered to support ideal rendering performance.

	> The performance requirements would depend on our deployment target (e.g., thin client, edge, labs, etc.). 

	> High level options:
	
		1. Front end clients with dedicated graphics and at least 16 GB of RAM.
		2. Container hosted in our K8s deployment that hosts the dedicated Cesium environment.
		3. Same as 2 above, but running the Cesium environment as a service which could scale a bit better. 
		4. Using a "cloud-compute" model such as Nvidia GeForce and streaming to our front end clients via a socket connection.
		5. MPG streaming for less interactive rendering scenarios. 

- How do users on the platform access it to include it as a UI element in their app? 

	> If it is integrated into our component library, it would be accessed and reference the same as any other component. 
	
	> If a more novel option is used, our platform is flexible to integrate with varied solutions (e.g., streaming, iframes, etc).

- Can do we create data connectors to push data for display on the globe? 

	> Yes, although stream and socket consumption use cases/examples are not prevalent. 

    - is that possible to create types to ease integration of data used for overlay in Cesium?

	>> Yes. C3 type system is specifically made to be generic and therefore facilitate integration. 

    - Do we need special converters to take data in Types and put into Cesium format like CZML or something else?  

	>> Not a requirement -- we can integrate at the platform level and push JSON data. 

- Can users within our platform bring up an IDE, create polygons, vehicles, etc for display in cesium? Any special steps to allow this to happen?

	>> Not at the moment. This would require customization beyond what we've implemented thus far.

## Conversation with ThreeJS

```md

Performing technical due diligence on a software platform like CesiumJS, especially considering deployment in an airgapped environment with limited client-side compute capabilities, requires a comprehensive assessment. Here's a detailed checklist to guide this process:

### General Evaluation

1. **Documentation Quality**: Assess the completeness, clarity, and accessibility of the documentation.
2. **Community and Support**: Evaluate the size and activity of the community, availability of support channels (forums, StackOverflow, GitHub issues).
3. **License Compliance**: Ensure that the software license is compatible with your intended use, especially in a restricted environment.

### Technical Assessment

1. **Source Code Review**:
   - **Quality and Maintainability**: Examine code quality, commenting, and organization.
   - **Dependencies**: List and evaluate third-party libraries and frameworks used.
   - **Security Vulnerabilities**: Check for known security issues in the codebase and dependencies.
   - **Customizability**: Determine how easily the software can be modified or extended.

2. **Performance**:
   
   - **Benchmarking**: Test performance under conditions that mimic the target environment.
   - **Resource Utilization**: Measure CPU, GPU, and memory usage.
   - **Optimization**: Evaluate the potential for performance optimization.

3. **Compatibility and Interoperability**:
   
   - **Browser Support**: Ensure compatibility with required web browsers.
   - **Data Format Support**: Confirm support for necessary geospatial data formats.
   - **Integration**: Assess how easily it integrates with existing systems and data sources.

4. **Scalability and Robustness**:
   
   - **Load Handling**: Test how the software behaves under high load or large datasets.
   - **Error Handling**: Check the system's ability to handle errors gracefully.
   - **Recovery Mechanisms**: Evaluate backup and recovery procedures.

### Security Assessment

1. **Code Security**: Look for common security vulnerabilities in the code (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
2. **Data Security**: Examine how data is stored, transmitted, and protected.
3. **Compliance**: Ensure adherence to relevant security standards and regulations.

### Deployment Considerations

1. **Airgapped Environment Compatibility**:
   - **Offline Functionality**: Confirm the software can function without internet access.
   - **Update Process**: Determine how updates will be managed and applied in an airgapped environment.
   - **Dependency Management**: Ensure all necessary dependencies can be included within the airgapped environment.

2. **Client-Side Compute Limitations**:
   - **Hardware Requirements**: Define minimum and recommended hardware specifications.
   - **Optimization for Low-Resource Environments**: Assess if the software can be optimized for environments with limited compute capabilities.

3. **Installation and Configuration**:
   - **Setup Process**: Review the complexity of the installation and configuration process.
   - **Customization**: Evaluate the ability to customize settings for an airgapped environment.

4. **Licensing and Cost**:
   - **Licensing Model**: Review the licensing model for compatibility with an airgapped, limited-resource deployment.
   - **Cost Analysis**: Consider both initial and ongoing costs associated with using and maintaining the software.

### Post-Deployment
1. **Maintenance and Support**:
   - **Software Updates**: Plan for regular software updates and patches.
   - **Technical Support**: Determine the availability and level of technical support.
2. **Training and Documentation**:
   - **User Training**: Develop a plan for training users on the software.
   - **Technical Documentation**: Ensure comprehensive documentation is available for system administrators.

### Conclusion
- **Final Evaluation**: Based on the gathered information, assess the overall suitability of CesiumJS for deployment in the specified environment.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify any potential risks or limitations discovered during the due diligence process.

### Additional Notes
- Tailor this checklist to the specific requirements of your project and the constraints of the airgapped environment.
- Consider conducting a pilot project or proof-of-concept to validate the feasibility of using CesiumJS in your intended setup.

Fine with TRANSCOM but prefers SOCOM. 

Ingestion, Integration, Modeling, Screens. 

Delegating/onboarding contractors. 

Eric and Richard -- suitecase provisioning. NIPR and SIPR deployments. NIPR/SIPR token is in process.
