## Notes

- Can we include base CesiumJS as a library as part of our runtime? 

	> Yes. 
	> 
	> 	c3 ui runs from a NodeJS environment. We tested cesium libraries against c3 libraries and were able to run a cesium application without any dependency conflicts.
	
	 List of c3 packages with an approved version on swaplist:

    - Does the globe visualization fit within our native UI framework or needs to be an iframe?

	 > Generally yes, we can import and use a CesiumGlobe component into our existing framework. 

    - If cesium is included, perhaps addl compute resources should be considered to support ideal rendering performance.

	> The performance requirements would depend on our deployment target (e.g., thin client, edge, labs, etc.). 

	> High level options:
	
		1. Front end clients with dedicated graphics and at least 16 GB of RAM.
		2. Container hosted in our K8s deployment that hosts the dedicated Cesium environment.
		3. Same as 2 above, but running the Cesium environment as a service which could scale a bit better. 
		4. Using a "cloud-compute" model such as Nvidia GeForce and streaming to our front end clients via a socket connection.
		5. MPG streaming for less interactive rendering scenarios. 

- How do users on the platform access it to include it as a UI element in their app? 

	> If it is integrated into our component library, it would be accessed and reference the same as any other component. 
	
	> If a more novel option is used, our platform is flexible to integrate with varied solutions (e.g., streaming, iframes, etc).

- Can do we create data connectors to push data for display on the globe? 

	> Yes, although stream and socket consumption use cases/examples are not prevalent. 

    - is that possible to create types to ease integration of data used for overlay in Cesium?

	>> Yes. C3 type system is specifically made to be generic and therefore facilitate integration. 

    - Do we need special converters to take data in Types and put into Cesium format like CZML or something else?  

	>> Not a requirement -- we can integrate at the platform level and push JSON data. 

- Can users within our platform bring up an IDE, create polygons, vehicles, etc for display in cesium? Any special steps to allow this to happen?

	>> Not at the moment. This would require customization beyond what we've implemented thus far.
