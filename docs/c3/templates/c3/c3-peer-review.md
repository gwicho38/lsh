I have worked with Person since my start at C3 and on various projects (including MDA and PSO). During my time working with Person I had the opportunity to collaborate on all aspects of the development process. Among these, regular code review, architecture conversations, testing, strategy, and team planning. Person is an exemplary employee who provides great value to C3.

In addition, Person exemplifies the C3 core values in the following manner:

1.  Person demonstrated "Innovation" by designing and implementing novel components with a tight deadline. For example, Person was crucial in the implementation of a multi-step form on PSO. This form has been leveraged by many other developers afterwards.  
    
2.  Person demonstrated "Curiosity" by researching and developing custom components on MDA. In particular, Person was able delve into unproven aspects of MDA to help in the building of a custom graph component.  
    
3.  Person demonstrated "Integrity" by always focusing on the quality of the product developed, even where this meant working beyond a standard work day (a situation that was contextually unavoidable). Additionally, Person is always kind and respectful to others around him, and is always willing to help new employees.  
    
4.  Person demonstrated "Collective Intelligence" by transferring his learnings and experience building custom components to other employees. For example, the MDA project leveraged his guidance and experience building custom components to greatly expand the program's ability to build robust UIs that closely adapted to the customer's desired use case. Currently, many members of the MDA program still refer back to his work as the archetype for UI component development.
