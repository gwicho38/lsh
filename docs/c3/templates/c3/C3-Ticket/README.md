# If you are asking a question,

1. Search for existing solutions before posting the question.

2. Select the right **category** based on the description, and **tags** (e.g., `data science`, `jupyter`, `model-deployment`, `metrics`, `ui`, etc.) for an easy search and for C3 employees to better assist you.

3. Briefly explain the goal, problem, context, and situation.

4. (If applicable) Copy and paste the sample/fake data, code (to reproduce the error), and error messages as text so that they are searchable (**No screenshots!**). Make sure you do not include sensitive data.

5. (If applicable) Format the data/code/error blocks using 3 backticks (```) on their own line above and below the block. Make sure there are no spaces on the lines with the backticks.
    See more code formatting examples [here](https://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/discourse-guide-code-formatting/30587).

6. Answer your own question after you find it (if applicable, otherwise please wait for someone to answer your question).

7. If you already know the answer while creating the question post, please make the question and the answer two separate posts.

8. Mark the answer post as the solution after you find it.

# [](https://community.c3.ai/t/c3-ai-community-best-practices/9472#if-you-are-posting-a-tip-of-the-day-3)If you are posting a “Tip of the Day”,

You have two options:

1. (More recommended) Mimic that you are asking a question so that others may be easier to find your post:

- Ask a question with the appropriate category and tags.
- Reply to the question.
- Mark the answer as the solution.

1. Share as a tip:

- Choose the category of the “Tip of the Day” to create the post.
- Add appropriate tags so that others can find your posts more easily.
- Reply to it on your own by “This is a tip of the day”. You can also mention that responding to a tip to add more context such as when this holds or not is (e.g. after version x.y, only if the input is…)
- Mark the answer as the solution
