# CI/CD Integration Dashboard Plan

## Overview
A comprehensive real-time CI/CD monitoring dashboard that integrates with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins to provide unified visibility into build pipelines, deployment status, and system health metrics.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Webhook Receiver Service**
   - Express.js API server listening for webhook events
   - Endpoints for GitHub, GitLab, and Jenkins webhooks
   - Event validation and authentication
   - Event normalization across platforms

2. **Data Storage Layer**
   - PostgreSQL for persistent pipeline history
   - Redis for real-time metrics and caching
   - Time-series data for trend analysis

3. **Real-time Processing**
   - WebSocket server for live updates
   - Event stream processing
   - Aggregation and metric calculation

4. **Dashboard Frontend**
   - React-based SPA with real-time updates
   - Responsive grid layout
   - Interactive charts and visualizations
   - Role-based views

## Key Metrics & KPIs

### Build Metrics
- **Build Duration**: Average, P50, P95, P99 percentiles
- **Build Success Rate**: Pass/fail ratio over time
- **Queue Time**: Time waiting for available runners
- **Build Frequency**: Builds per hour/day/week

### Test Metrics
- **Test Pass Rate**: Percentage of passing tests
- **Test Coverage**: Code coverage percentage
- **Flaky Test Detection**: Tests that fail intermittently
- **Test Duration**: Time to run test suites

### Deployment Metrics
- **Deployment Frequency**: Deploys per day/week
- **Lead Time for Changes**: Commit to production time
- **Change Failure Rate**: Failed deployments percentage
- **MTTR**: Mean time to recovery from failures

### Pipeline Health
- **Pipeline Success Rate**: End-to-end success percentage
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Slowest pipeline stages
- **Resource Utilization**: Runner/agent usage
- **Cost Analytics**: Cloud resource costs per pipeline

## Integration Points

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
webhook_events:
  - workflow_run
  - workflow_job
  - check_run
  - deployment
  - deployment_status

data_collected:
  - workflow_id, run_id, job_id
  - status: queued, in_progress, completed
  - conclusion: success, failure, cancelled
  - timing: started_at, completed_at
  - artifacts: logs, test_results
```

### GitLab CI
```yaml
webhook_events:
  - pipeline_events
  - job_events
  - deployment_events
  - merge_request_events

data_collected:
  - pipeline_id, job_id, project_id
  - status: created, running, success, failed
  - stages: build, test, deploy
  - duration, queue_duration
  - coverage_percentage
```

### Jenkins
```yaml
webhook_events:
  - build_started
  - build_completed
  - test_results
  - deployment_status

data_collected:
  - job_name, build_number
  - result: SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNSTABLE
  - duration, queue_id
  - test_results: passed, failed, skipped
  - console_output_url
```
