# Release 0.6.0 - Secrets Manager Repositioning

**Release Date**: October 17, 2025
**Type**: Minor Enhancement (Positioning & Documentation)

## Overview

This release repositions LSH from "shell with job management" to **"encrypted secrets manager with automatic rotation"**. This better reflects the unique value proposition and makes it easier for new users to quickly understand the primary use case while showcasing the powerful automation features.

## What's New

### 🎯 Primary Positioning: Secrets Manager

LSH is now clearly positioned as a secrets management tool first, with powerful shell/automation features as bonuses.

**Key Message**: "Never copy .env files again. Push once, pull anywhere, rotate automatically."

### 📚 Documentation Overhaul

**README.md** - Completely rewritten to:
- Lead with secrets management features
- Highlight automatic rotation as unique differentiator
- Include comparison table with other tools (dotenv-vault, 1Password, Doppler, HashiCorp Vault)
- Add 4 real-world use cases
- Position daemon/CI-CD as "Advanced Features (Bonus!)"

**CLAUDE.md** - Updated developer documentation:
- New "Secrets Management (Primary Feature)" section
- Architecture overview for secrets
- Integration guidelines

### 💻 Enhanced CLI Experience

Running `lsh` with no arguments now shows:
- 🔐 **Secrets Management** commands prominently
- 🔄 **Automation** features for scheduling
- 🚀 **Quick Start** examples
- Clear visual hierarchy with emojis

### 📖 Practical Examples Added

New `examples/secrets-rotation/` directory with:
- **`rotate-api-keys.sh`** - Automated API key rotation script
- **`auto-sync-secrets.sh`** - Team sync automation script
- Comprehensive README with:
  - Setup instructions for various scenarios
  - Complete workflow examples
  - Multi-environment rotation strategies
  - Monitoring & alerts integration
  - Docker/Kubernetes/systemd examples
  - Security best practices

### 🔑 Updated Keywords & Metadata

**package.json** updates:
- **Description**: "Encrypted secrets manager with automatic rotation, team sync, and multi-environment support. Built on a powerful shell with daemon scheduling and CI/CD integration."
- **Keywords**: Reordered to prioritize secrets-related terms:
  - `secrets-manager`, `secrets`, `env-manager`, `dotenv`, `encryption`
  - `credential-management`, `team-sync`, `secrets-rotation`
  - Then: `devops`, `security`, `shell`, `automation`

## The Unique Value Proposition

**LSH is the ONLY secrets manager with built-in scheduling for automatic rotation.**

While other tools require external cron, complex CI/CD setup, or additional infrastructure, LSH combines:
- ✅ Simple 2-minute setup
- ✅ Built-in daemon + scheduler
- ✅ Self-hosted option (Supabase)
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ Easy automation

## Files Changed

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Complete rewrite with secrets-first approach
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added secrets management section
- `docs/releases/0.5.14.md` - This release note

### Code
- `src/cli.ts` - Updated default output and description
- `package.json` - Updated description and keywords
- `types/lib/secrets-manager.d.ts` - Added force parameter to pull method

### New Files
- `examples/secrets-rotation/rotate-api-keys.sh`
- `examples/secrets-rotation/auto-sync-secrets.sh`
- `examples/secrets-rotation/README.md`

## GitHub Issues Created

As part of this release, we've created issues to track improvements:

- **#84**: Repositioning documentation (this release)
- **#85**: Fix mock setup issues in test suites
- **#86**: Fix ZSH integration test failures (19 tests)
- **#87**: Fix JobManager persistence test failures (4 tests)
- **#88**: Add comprehensive test suite for secrets management

## Breaking Changes

None. This is purely a positioning and documentation update. All existing functionality remains unchanged and fully compatible.

## Migration Guide

No migration needed. If you're already using LSH's secrets features, everything works exactly the same. The changes are purely in how we present and document the tool.

## For Existing Users

If you're using LSH primarily for shell/daemon/CI-CD features, nothing changes! All those features remain fully functional and documented. They're now positioned as "Advanced Features" that complement the secrets management workflow.

## For New Users

New users will now see:
1. **Quick Start**: Generate key → Push secrets → Pull anywhere
2. **Unique Feature**: Automatic rotation with built-in scheduling
3. **Bonus Features**: Powerful shell, daemon, CI/CD integration
