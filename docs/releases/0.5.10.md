# Release Notes - Version 0.5.10

**Release Date:** 2025-10-15
**Previous Version:** 0.5.9

## Summary

This release improves the CLI user experience by showing a clean, brief message when running `lsh` without arguments, while preserving detailed help when explicitly requested.

## Changes

### Improved Default Output

**Problem:**
When running `lsh` without any arguments, Commander.js would display verbose help output including all options, making it overwhelming for users who just want to see what's available.

**Solution:**
Show a concise usage message by default, and only display detailed help when explicitly requested.

#### Before (v0.5.9):
```bash
$ lsh

Usage: lsh [options] [command]

LSH - A modern shell with ZSH features and superior job management

Options:
  -V, --version                output the version number
  -i, --interactive            Start interactive shell
  -c, --command <command>      Execute command string
  -s, --script <file>          Execute script file
  --rc <file>                  Use custom rc file
  --zsh-compat                 Enable ZSH compatibility mode
  --source-zshrc               Source ~/.zshrc configuration
  --package-manager <manager>  Package manager (npm, yarn, brew, apt, yum)
  -v, --verbose                Verbose output
  -d, --debug                  Debug mode
  -h, --help                   display help for command

Commands:
  script [options] <file>      Execute a shell script
  config [options]             Manage LSH configuration
  ...
```

#### After (v0.5.10):
```bash
$ lsh

LSH - A modern shell with ZSH features and superior job management

Usage: lsh [options] [command]

Quick Start:
  lsh -i                  Start interactive shell
  lsh --help              Show detailed help
  lsh self update         Update to latest version

For full documentation, run: lsh help
```

### Help Still Works

All help options continue to work as expected:

**Detailed Commander Help:**
```bash
lsh --help    # Shows all options and commands
lsh -h        # Same as --help
```

**Custom Detailed Help:**
```bash
lsh help      # Shows comprehensive help with examples
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner First Impression**: New users see a simple, welcoming message
2. **Reduced Clutter**: No overwhelming list of options by default
3. **Clear Path Forward**: Shows exactly how to get more help
4. **Quick Start**: Highlights the most common commands
5. **Backwards Compatible**: All help flags still work as expected
