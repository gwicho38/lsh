# Release Notes - Version 0.5.4

**Release Date:** 2025-10-15
**Previous Version:** 0.5.3

## Summary

This release renames the npm package from `gwicho38-lsh` to `lsh-framework` for better discoverability and branding.

## Breaking Changes

### Package Name Change

The npm package has been renamed from `gwicho38-lsh` to `lsh-framework`.

**Migration:**

```bash
npm uninstall -g gwicho38-lsh
```

Then install the new package:
