# Script to recursively 'touch' all files in the current directory,
# including hidden files and following symbolic links.

# The 'find' command is used to list all files:
# . represents the current directory
# -type f finds regular files (including hidden files)
# -L option makes find follow symbolic links
# {} is a placeholder for each file found
# + at the end executes 'touch' for files in batches, making it more efficient than using \;

find . -type f -exec touch {} +

# To explicitly include hidden files and directories in the search,
# and ensure symbolic links are followed, no additional flags are required
# since the -type f option will include hidden files, and -L option already makes find follow links.

echo "All files (including hidden and linked) have been touched."
