The resulting anti-ship version of the YJ-91 is\\ncapable of sea-skimming. Its cruising altitude is no more than 20 metre above sea level. At the terminal attack\\nstage (usually after the active radar seeker of the missile is turned on), the missile drops to 7 metre above sea\\nlevel. This attack altitude can be further reduced to just 1.2 metre above sea level, when the sea state allows.\\nAlternatively, the missile can be programmed to popup-and-dive like that the Boeing Harpoon. However, such\\nsea-skimming capability comes at the expense of maximum range: in comparison to the original 70 km range of\\nthe Kh-31A, the maximum range of YJ-91 anti-ship missile was reduced by more than a quarter to 50 km. Like\\nthe anti-radiation version, it is reported that many planned upgrades are in development. An application for\\nresearch grants to develop a submerged launched version of YJ-91 anti-ship missile once appeared on\\nChinese websites on the Internet, indicating China is attempting to develop a version for its submarine fleet.\\nVariants\\nYJ-91 Anti-Radiation Missile: The anti-radiation version of the\",","\t\t\t\t\t\"pageNumber\": 2","\t\t\t\t},","\t\t\t\t\"score\": 22.608194,","\t\t\t\t\"rank\": 4,","\t\t\t\t\"source\": \"8e592158-bbd3-4254-9a6f-343ec2bdb31d#1\",","\t\t\t\t\"source_id\": \"8e592158-bbd3-4254-9a6f-343ec2bdb31d\",","\t\t\t\t\"source_type_name\": \"Genai.SourceFile\"","\t\t\t}","\t\t},","\t\t{","\t\t\t\"page_content\": \"For Training Use Only\\nExported (UTC) @ 7/12/23, 1:28 AMto a seeker that covers multiple frequency bands, additional measures to upgrade the missile are in\\ndevelopment, such as, an open software architecture.
