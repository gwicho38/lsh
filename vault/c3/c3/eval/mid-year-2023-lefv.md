I achieved key goals during our current mid-year cycle - with more work to be done. In the first half of the cycle, I was a key contributor on the MDA PTS team post application deployment on IL6. Of note, I worked with my colleagues to deploy PTS on a Kubernetes-based  IL6 airgapped environment. A key aspect of my work involved root-causing an in-production issue that precluded model generation.

More recently, I have been part of the CORNEA GURU trial team: among the first Federal projects developed on v8. The GURU application is also among the first Federal extension of the "GenAi" base application from both a Data Science and Engineering perspective. 

In doing so, along with my Engineering and Data Science colleagues, we are providing a well-documented and test-driven template for our colleagues embarking on the coming v8 migrations. 

In addition to playing a key part of successful application delivery for MDA and the first GenAi Federal extension, I achieved my goal for mentoring and onboarding new C3 employees (the majority of which were new professionals). Under the guidance of the Federal Engineering Management team, I've been able to serve as interim Federal Engineering Manager which provides me with a greater ability to help mentor new C3 engineers. 

Another challenging goal met was continuing to attend UIUC's MS in CS program. By the end of 2023, I will be halfway through my MS program.  My courses have ranged from Applied Machine Learning, Cloud Networking, and Text Information Systems. These courses have already supplemented existing knowledge and allowed me to be a more effective contributor at C3.

Finally, I'm looking forward to playing a greater part in managing our customer needs. In particular, as the CORNEA GURU Pilot is in its final stages, a key goal/deliverable will be creating a template for how Federal extension of base applications can be carried out.

Below is an overview of how my work supports C3's competencies.

Technical Capability:

Over the past fiscal year I've developed expertise in various facets of the platform.

- Core competency:

    - Designed, developed, and deployed MDA PTS and CORNEA GURU. Developed Platform depth while onboarding to v8, filing various P0 tickets, and contributing to Community.

    - Developed a UI extension strategy that allows for extension of any base components with minimal code changes.

    - Developed and documented the process of running a local v8 SNE. 

- Enterprise AI application development:

    - Led low-side Pilot application development. Was counted on to decompose complex product specifications into organized engineering efforts.

    - Contributed to the architecture, specification, and testing of the GURU orchestrated LLM pipeline. As a result of the hard work of our team, GURU application has been extended to a second Pilot by way of formal contract.

    - Provided guidance to engineer reports as interim manager while maintaining effective feature delivery. 

- Process and results:

    - Ensured high-quality delivery of CORNEA GURU by documenting and filing various Platform tickets. Verified that development by our core team applied C3 AI standards, guidelines, and best practices.

Business Acumen:

I've advised, guided, and presented core application functionality to our Pilot team and cross-functional colleagues.

- Domain expertise:

    - Implemented key GURU features while onboarding to v8 and serving as interim Engineering Manager. This required acquiring knowledge of generative LLMs, vector-embedding models, query orchestration, UI module federation, and C3 inheritance rules. 

    - Provided recommendations on future staffing requirements.

- Analytical thinking:

    - Led discussions on the low-side application development for GURU. 

- Value creation:

    - Provided schematic for future Federal v8 extensions.
    
    - Identified specifications and requirements for Federal v8 application deployments. 

    - Shared knowledge and mentored new C3 employees. 

Relationships:

I've been counted on to communicate how C3 leverages the platform to explore potential business needs.

- Customer service:

    - Explained challenges (e.g., with respect to application scope) and business process limitations (e.g., where custom customer processes could not be generalized) to internal and external stakeholders. Advice was used to narrow focus and deliver a more robust application core.

- Relationship management:

    - Worked across various segments of C3 (including base applications and platform) to root cause various novel v8 issues. 

- Communication:

    - Provided LoE estimates and digested explanations that were used by our Solution Colleagues to prioritize feature delivery. 

Leadership:

I hold myself accountable for the success of development efforts. One of my proudest moments at C3 was being able to serve in an interim Engineering Manager capacity. I enjoy working with new professionals as a bridge to build their confidence and leverage their talent. As AI moves beyond its nascent stages, developer self-sufficiency can help C3 scale development and profitability.

- Leading self:

    - Held myself accountable for the successes and failures of my project team, taking responsibility for project outcomes.

- Leading others:

    - Attended to the needs of reports while serving as Interim Manager. 

- Strengthening C3 AI:

    - Represented C3 AI when interacting with external peers and received positive feedback for our collaborative nature.

In what area(s) would you most like to improve in the coming months?

I would like to continue developing my leadership skills, particularly in coaching and mentoring others. Additionally, I would like to strengthen my technical skills in machine learning and data analysis to better support the development of enterprise AI applications.

Is there anything you would like to share with your manager regarding your performance and how you embody the C3 AI Values?

I strongly believe in the C3 AI Values and strive to embody them in my work every day. I value collaboration, integrity, and innovation and believe in creating an inclusive and supportive environment for all team members. I appreciate the opportunities provided by C3 AI for professional development and am committed to continued learning and growth.
