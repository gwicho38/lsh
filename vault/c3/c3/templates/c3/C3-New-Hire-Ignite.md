## Post-Arrival (0 - 6 months)

###### WEEK 1 (TRAINING)

During this week, your mentee will take the C3.ai Platform Fundamentals course. Expect this course to take at least this entire week, and probably a few days into Week 2. If training is happening onsite, your mentee will attend that training; otherwise, they will just do it at their desk through Litmow. Be on hand to answer any questions your mentee has about the Litmos, the C3 AI Suite, and the office in general.

Mentor responsibilities Week 1:

- `SCHEDULE` Conduct a short (30 minute) daily check-in with your mentee
- Invite your mentee to your daily subteam standup
- Help your mentee progress through C3.ai Platform Fundamentals
- Include your mentee in as much of your daily routine as possible (team walks, for example)
- Join your mentee for lunch each day; sit with different groups each day and introduce your mentee to as many people as possible

###### WEEK 2 (TRAINING CONTINUED)

Your mentee will continue to work on the C3.ai Platform Fundamentals course and complete the Advanced Application Course. At the end of this week, your mentee should have a fully functioning lightbulb application that is demo-able. On Friday, he or she will present a short demo of the extended lightbulb application to a larger engineering audience. 

- `SCHEDULE` Conduct a short (30 minute) daily check-in with your mentee
- Help your mentee progress through C3.ai Platform Fundamentals course
- Help your mentee progress through the C3.ai Advanced Application Development course
- `SCHEDULE` Conduct [Onboarding Retrospective 1](https://c3energy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SAM/pages/946438200/Retrospective+1+-+C3+AI+Suite+Fundamentals) on Friday with your mentee and his or her manager
- On Friday, join your mentee's manager in introducing your mentee to the Project Team manager who will be responsible for your mentee's rotation

###### WEEKS 3-8 (FDE PROJECT ROTATION FULL-TIME HIRES ONLY)

During weeks 3 through 8, your mentee will be on rotation with an FDE customer project engineering team. As your mentee will effectively be a member of the FDE team, regardless of whether you are an SE or FDE, your involvement should be less than the prior two weeks. Your mentee will have an FDE Project Lead who will provide guidance and support throughout the rotation. That said, make sure to stay in close contact with your mentee and check in on his or her progress through his or her rotation.

- `SCHEDULE` Conduct short (30 minute) at-least-biweekly (every other week) check-ins with your mentee
- `SCHEDULE` Conduct [Onboarding Retrospective 2](https://c3energy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SAM/pages/946438628/Retrospective+2+-+FDE+Customer+Project+Onboarding+Rotation) with your mentee and his or her manager at the conclusion of the rotation
- [SE ONLY] Ensure mentee is progressing through the badge program

###### MONTHS 3-6 (EXTENDED RAMP UP)

Your mentee has now finished the training stage of his or her on-boarding and is now ready to be deployed on customer projects. At this point, your mentee should be pretty comfortable with the office, team, and our products. Your needed involvement as a mentor should slowly decrease over the course of these three months; tailor your mentorship during this period to be as hands-on or hands-off as your mentee requires.

- `SCHEDULE` Conduct short (30 minute) at-least-biweekly (every other week) check-ins with your mentee
- `SCHEDULE` Conduct [Onboarding Retrospective 3](https://c3energy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SAM/pages/949158061/Retrospective+3+-+FDE+Onboarding+and+Mentorship) with your mentee and his or her manager at the conclusion of the extended ramp up
