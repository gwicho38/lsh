# Question 1

**To what extent did you achieve your work objectives?**

My objectives covered FY2023 Q2. I used the C3 Core Values (Innovation, Curiosity, Integrity, and Collective Intelligence) as a guide in building the same. My resulting objectives were as follows:

[list of objectives]

I achieved my objectives to the following extent:

```ts

__.forEach(Objective, (objective) => {
	list(objective);
	var result = didAchieve(objective);
	explain(result);
})

```

# Question 2

**I: What went well?
**II: What could have gone better?**

# Question 3

**Is there anything you would like to share with your manager regarding your performance and how you embody the C3 Values?**

I have worked with since my start at C3 and on various projects (including MDA and PSO). During my time working with Armen I had the opportunity to collaborate on all aspects of the development process. Among these, regular code review, architecture conversations, testing, strategy, and team planning. Armen is an exemplary employee who provides great value to C3.

In addition, my behavior exemplifies the C3 core values in the following manner:

1. Armen demonstrated "Innovation" by designing and implementing novel components with a tight deadline. For example, Armen was crucial in the implementation of a multi-step form on PSO. This form has been leveraged by many other developers afterwards.
2. Armen demonstrated "Curiosity" by researching and developing custom components on MDA. In particular, Armen was able delve into unproven aspects of MDA to help in the building of a custom graph component.
3. Armen demonstrated "Integrity" by always focusing on the quality of the product developed, even where this meant working beyond a standard work day (a situation that was contextually unavoidable). Additionally, Armen is always kind and respectful to others around him, and is always willing to help new employees.
4. Armen demonstrated "Collective Intelligence" by transferring his learnings and experience building custom components to other employees. For example, the MDA project leveraged his guidance and experience building custom components to greatly expand the program's ability to build robust UIs that closely adapted to the customer's desired use case. Currently, many members of the MDA program still refer back to his work as the archetype for UI component development.
