Subject: Ignite Onboarding

Hi [Name]:

Welcome to C3! As your Ignite buddy, my goal is to support you from your onboarding through your first six months at C3.

I've sent over a welcome meeting where we'll be able to talk about your goals for onboarding. If in doubt, I am here to be a single point of contact for questions you may have as you get up to speed.

I also wanted to provide you with a quick heads up on key things for the first few days:

- C3 RWC is 1300 Seaport Blvd #500, Redwood City, CA 94063.
  
	- Sean (your manager) will be meeting you at the lobby on your first day.
	  
- I9 Documentation requirements (as described in Greenhouse) should be met
  
- Phone Charger
  
- Headphones
  
- Backpack (or another bag). If you haven't ordered your C3 bag already you may want to do so soon!
  
- Onboarding instructions will be provided by your manager, but you may find a useful cross reference here: [FDE/SE Onboarding Materials - Services - Confluence (atlassian.net)](https://c3energy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SAM/pages/8173748234/FDE+SE+Onboarding+Materials)

During your first few days, C3 should provide:

- Laptop and charger
  
- Desk
  
- Notebooks and other office supplies as you may need

Should anything come up that requires immediate attention, please also don't hesitate to contact me at +1.305.281.6028.

Best of luck settling in!

Luis
