General, please join me in celebrating Patrick's (1/23/23) and Richard's (1/30/2023) 1st C3 Anniversary! 

It has been a privilege to have them on our team and to support them as their manager. It has been hard not to be impressed by their work. From new c3 employees to leading teams and learning new technologies on the fly. 

Here's to your second year at C3!

Michael, there are so many things to say, that I'm honestly struggling with where to even start. Countless company initiatives, important customer engagements, critical technical capabilities, engineers mentored.... the amount you've accomplished and contributed in 3 years is staggering. The company and I have so much to thank you for. I, and many of your peers, continue to admire the technical excellence and work ethic you demonstrate on a daily basis. It's been such a pleasure having you on the team for this crazy journey, and your continued leadership makes me confident that we can continue tackling any craziness that lies ahead.
