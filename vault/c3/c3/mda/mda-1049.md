## 📝 Notes
#### Stages of Ballistic Missile
A [ballistic missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile "Ballistic missile") goes through several distinct phases of flight that are common to almost all such designs. 

**boost phase** when the main boost rocket or upper stages are firing, 

**post-boost phase** when any last-minute changes to the trajectory are made by the upper stage or [warhead bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle "Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle") and the warheads and any decoys are released, 

**midcourse** which represents most of the flight when the objects coast, 

**terminal phase** as the warhead approaches its target and, for longer-ranged missiles, begins to [reenter the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry "Atmospheric entry").

### Inertial Reference Frames
In order to describe the position, velocity, and orientation of an object of interest, the object's motion must be compared to a type of standard known as a reference frame. 

A reference frame is comprised of an origin that defines a position in space and three orthogonal unit vectors or axes that make up a right-handed system. These three axes are typically denoted by x-y-z or via subscripts 1-2-3. 

There are numerous reference frames that can be used to measure an object's motion depending on the type of application and desired results, such as a sensor frame, a body frame, an Earth-centered, Earth-fixed (ECEF) frame, or a local North-East-Down (NED) frame. 

### Geographic/Geodetic Coordinate System
Within the ECEF reference frame, there are two primary coordinate systems used when describing a system's position: cartesian and geodetic. The cartesian coordinate system uses the ExEx, EyEy, and EzEz axes to represent an object's position directly. 

The geodetic coordinate system is essentially a set of polar coordinates, but one that accounts for the first-order effect of Earth being an ellipsoid rather than a sphere, and describes an object's ECEF position in terms latitude (ϕϕ), longitude (λλ), and altitude (hh).

## Questions/Thoughts
TrajectoryModel is the model for the kinematic/ir trajectory for a given missile/launchpoint

How can I target api endpoint for each canonical?

	'bmrd' -> RawBMRD58ColumnTrajectoryFile

	local env?

	aws?

What changes to source/transform for reference trajectory files need to be made to ingest into a collection type?

How to document endpoint information so that customer can upload trajectory/canonical data?

## Ticket Information
_threat_ is a missile

```md
0) Create dummy data for testing (can be very simply to start, and augmented with a further ticket)

1) Ingest hierarchy to C3 to a collection (see FileSourceSystem/FileSourceCollection) (for now, a script to push (0) to a specified bucket should be fine)

2) Augment existing types (add a field to ReferenceTrajectory keeping track of its monte carlo run # and object specifier) (couple lines of code change)

```

%%Relevant Process%%

`CreateReferenceTrajectoriesEpic`
`IRTrajectory`
`MDADemoDataGenerator`
`IRTrajectoryPoint`
`[GeoTrajectoryPoint]` belongs to `GeoTrajectory` and is extended by ReferenceTrajectory

ReferenceTrajectory: {
	GeoTrajectory: [GeoTrajectoryPoints]
	[IRTrajectories]
}
`GeneratedTrajectory` 
Solution: Scenario (Calendar) has ReferenceTrajectoryCollection (WorkingDays) which has ReferenceTrajectories (workingShifts)

See PsoTest.js for creating relational data. 

ParentTrajectory {

```ts

ReferenceTrajectoryCollection {
	referenceTrajectoryRelations: [ParentTrajectoryToReferenceTrajectoryRelation](parentTrajectory)

	refeTrajectories: [ReferenceTrajectory] calc 'referenceTrajectoryRelations.parentTrajectory'	
}



```
