### GPU for AI/ML Licesning

```
Hey JP and Russ,

Regarding your inquiry of getting licenses for GPUs for AI/ML data science work, our field ops team got back to us with some steps to get that setup. 

In order to create C3 worker pods to utilize the GPUs, the helm chart configurations would need to be changed. An example of that is attached to this email. The important pieces that need to be updated are the “nodeSelector” and the “nvidia.com/gpu” requests/limits in the resources section. The “nodeSelector” field in the Helm chart will depend on the GPU type (if it’s not NVIDIA then it would be something else).

Depending on the type of GPU, a NVIDIA driver or something similar will likely need to be installed. Instructions here: [https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.nvidia.com%2Fdatacenter%2Fcloud-native%2Fgpu-operator%2Flatest%2Fgetting-started.html&data=05%7C02%7Cluis.fernandez-de-la-vara%40c3.ai%7C212a22f9a22d445b572a08dc23772a63%7C53ad779a93e7485cba20ac8290d7252b%7C1%7C0%7C638424241922059700%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=gPA9lf75g2R%2BV2TP120M16lzwUiCG9hlAgqocxkNRBM%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html. Click or tap if you trust this link.")

In order to add new nodes to an RKE cluster, Rancher details the steps (assuming the node has a GPU already installed) here: [https://rke.docs.rancher.com/managing-clusters#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20add%20additional,list%20in%20the%20original%20cluster.](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frke.docs.rancher.com%2Fmanaging-clusters%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520order%2520to%2520add%2520additional%2Clist%2520in%2520the%2520original%2520cluster.&data=05%7C02%7Cluis.fernandez-de-la-vara%40c3.ai%7C212a22f9a22d445b572a08dc23772a63%7C53ad779a93e7485cba20ac8290d7252b%7C1%7C0%7C638424241922069830%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=VplVXTe6c7B3C%2BWSACIrs1et0IL5V7jyAAaBfEjQcSQ%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://rke.docs.rancher.com/managing-clusters#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20add%20additional,list%20in%20the%20original%20cluster..

Let us know if there are any issues or concerns and the team will be ready to assist.

Thanks,

Eric

Go through - get an understanding on what they're working. Get context about the broader project as a whole. 


## REQUIREMENTS

> [!NOTE] Added to IT Support Staff List?
> 
> Sometime between Oct 17th, 2022 and February 27th, 2023, IT Support stopped adding new employees (or at least my newest team members) to the `C3 Staff` distribution list. Because of this, Parvesh, Ben, and Brendan did not receive email notifications about stock trading blackout windows and probably some other important information. I plan on submitting an IT ticket on behalf of them to get them added to the distro list.

> [!NOTE]  Partner Engineer Concerns.If partnership engineer concerns:
	1) invest more coaching for next sprint
	2) alert the services PoC where they get 2 more weeks to ramp up support

> [!NOTE] Partnership Engineer Info Page? 
> Confluence page. 

@billing 
> Billing Time for Base App Contributions

```
Please bill time in Open Air to the base application charge code for time you spend writing designing or writing code that is a PR to a base application you are contributing to. Please start for whatever timesheets you have not yet submitted in the past or this week. We are working to set up a charge code per base application, and we will send a note out when everyone has been added to this.
```

@contractor 
### Onboarding Contractors

```
The company is implementing a unified process for all contractor onboarding/offboarding.  We are now supposed to use a form off of Netsuite.  However, I am sure it will require an SOW to be in place.  We currently have not unfilled positions on any of our Paradyme SOWs.  So until we get Alex or Adi to secure approval of the Paradyme mega-SOW request, I think we have to lean forward and do this informally through Sid.

The first SOW we pass will be for Fed Base Apps.  As soon as it is signed, we can formally move the engineers that have already been moved to products, but are charging against our RDIM and PDA SOWs to that the new Fed Base Apps SOW.  That will open up the RDIM and PDA slots for new Paradyme engineers.

So, I think what I’m saying is that we need to use our Sid “magical” power if it’s still available for Sanjay.
```

@testing @brett 
### TESTING

2024-02-28

```txt

To fix that going forward, we expect the following from all projects (note that these are not new):

- 80% test coverage across all metrics on v8 projects as measure by the Release Mgt Test Coverage Report

- v7 projects are exempt from reporting only due to complexity in setup. Please try to maintain high test coverage.

- 100% passing tests on all static branches (master, release, develop, trunk, etc.)

- If we get yellow/red builds on any static branches it requires a P0 mid sprint ticket

- Tests are included in the Definition of Done

- All PRs either require >= 80% test coverage OR an explanation of why a test is not needed

- All GitHub repositories should have branch protections enabled and require RM status checks before merging.
- Level of effort estimations should include writing automated tests – communicate any impacts to timelines ASAP.

If you get **_any_** pushback on the above requirements from anyone – SMs, DMs, Practice Leads, etc. – please tell them to raise the issue with Bus or myself. If you feel your project deserves an exemption from any of these requirements, please reach out.
