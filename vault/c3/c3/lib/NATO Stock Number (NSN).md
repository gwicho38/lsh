# NATO Stock Number (NSN)

#DefenseIntel



## Overview

A 13-digit numeric code identifying all the 'standardized material items of supply' as they have been recognized by all NATO countries.

***It is used in all NATO treaty countries.***

There are, however, countries that use NSN that are ***not*** members of NATO (e.g. Japan, Australia, New Zealand).

***A two-digit Material Management Aggregation Code (MMAC) suffix may also be appended***[^1] to denote asset end use but it is not considered part of the NSN. In the UK, this is known as the Domestic Management Code (DMC).

```ad-note
An item having an NSN is said to be "stock-listed."
```

## Structure

The NATO Stock Number consists of the NATO Supply Class (NSC or FSC) and the National Item Identification Number (NIIN). However the NIIN alone uniquely identifies the item, the FSC merely adds context by indicating the general classification of the item. The format of an NSN might be described as follows:

`abcd-ef-ghi-jklm`

Each element $a$ through $m$, was originally intended to be a single decimal digit. As inventories grew in complexity, element $g$ became alphanumeric, beginning with uppercase $A$ for certain newly-added items. By 2000, upperacse $C$ was in use.

### Federal Supply Classification Group (FSCG)

The initial subgroup, $abcd$, is the [Federal Supply Classification Group (FSCG)](Federal%20Supply%20Classification%20Group%20(FSCG).md).[^2] In theory, similar items would always have closely related numbers in this section of the NSN, no matter how the section is referred to. As the number of items has steadily increased and the system has become more complicated, it has not always been possible to keep similarity in numbers when the items are similar..

### National Item Identification Number (NIIN)

The nine digits, $ef$-$ghi$-$jklm$, comprise the [National Item Identification Number (NIIN)](National%20Item%20Identification%20Number%20(NIIN).md).
