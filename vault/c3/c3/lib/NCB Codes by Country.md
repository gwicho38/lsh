[^1]: The Republic of North Macedonia (formerly the [Former Yugoslavian Republic of] Macedonia) is a country based on the borders of "Slavic" Macedonia within the former Yugoslavia. It was involved in a [naming dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute "Macedonia naming dispute") with Greece, which contains the territory of ["Greek" Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(Greece) "Macedonia (Greece)") and the historical [kingdom of Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom) "Macedonia (ancient kingdom)") within its borders. This was resolved in June, 2018 and the nation was renamed the Republic of North Macedonia beginning in February, 2019.
[^2]: Afghanistan is no longer a Tier 1 member of the NCB since its government's fall on August 15, 2021.
