# National Item Identification Number (NIIN)

#DefenseIntel


## Overview

The nine digits $ef$-$ghi$-$jklm$ in a [NATO Stock Number (NSN)](NATO%20Stock%20Number%20(NSN).md) comprise the NIIN.

This format improves readability but it is optional as NIINs are often listed without hyphens.

The first two digits of the NIIN (the $ef$ pair) is used to record which country was the first to codify the item -- which one first recognized it as an important item of supply. ***This is generally the country of origin***, meaning the ***country of final manufacture.***

The formal name of the field is CC for Country Code or NCB, because NCB also stands for [National Codification Bureau](National%20Codification%20Bureau). The NCB is the organization, typically government agency, in charge of maintaining the NCS database within a given country.  ***The other seven characters are a non-significant identification code.***
