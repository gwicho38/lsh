# Drop Tanks



***Drop Tanks*** (AKA ***external tanks***, ***wing tanks***, or ***belly tanks***) are terms for ***auxiliary fuel tanks*** carried on the exterior of the aircraft via [Hardpoint](Hardpoint.md).

Drop tanks are designed to be expendable, and most often designed for easy jettison (to ditch & run, or to extend range after expense of fuel).

They are very commonly found on both military & civilian aircraft, though civilian aircraft will not jettison them as cost and the environment are large considerations.
