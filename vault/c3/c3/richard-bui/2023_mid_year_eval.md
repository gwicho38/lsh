Over the first half of the 2024 fiscal year, Richard has developed significantly as an engineer. Richard has contributed primarily to the Stark Property Assessment pilot, as well as other Property Assessment projects and most recently CDAO SOCOM. Richard's peers are impressed with his tenacity, curiosity, and uncompromising commitment to build his application to spec.

As Richard continues to grow in his current role in C3, I expect him to focus on the following:

1. Go deeper into the C3 tech stack. Since joining C3 nearly 1 year ago, Richard has had the opportunity to work on most parts of the tech stack: data ingestion, data modeling, and frontend development. However, there are more complex topics that I believe Richard can go deeper on, such as distributed computing, database technology, and UI frameworks (specifically React). Richard has shown growth in all aspects of the technical stack, and I expect him to continue this trajectory over the next 6 months.

1. Take ownership over the projects he works on. Richard has primarily worked as a contributing engineer on most projects, so he has not had the opportunity to lead customer conversations or guide project direction. However, he should feel empowered to find these opportunities even in a contributing role. Richard should make an effort to focus on the bigger picture of a project and find ways to grow the skillsets required to become a project lead.

		if there are features that should be taken on

1. Learn how to prioritize features. As one of his peers points out, Richard refuses to cut corners on features that have been requested. However, as he takes more ownership of projects going forward, he will need to learn how to prioritize features when under time constraints, communicate to delivery managers what can and cannot be accomplished, and still deliver a quality product.

I believe focusing on these three growth areas will accelerate Richard's growth as an engineer at C3. Thank you Richard for
