```c

char *mail_auth(char * mechanism, authresponse_t resp, int argc, char *argv[]){
  chart tmp[MAILTMPLEN];
  AUTHENTICATOR * AUTH;

  ucase(strcpy(tmp, mechnism));
  for(auth = mailauthenticators; auth; auth = auth->next)

    if(auth->serer && !strcmp(auth->name, tmp))
      return (*auth->server) (resp, argc, argv);

	return NIL; 
}

```

# Solution

The above shows part of the vulnerable code on the University of Washingtonâ€™s IMAP server, which was corrected in 1998. We can see that it never checks the size of the data  in mechanism before copying to tmp , which could result in a buffer overflow. The error is easily resolved by a check using strlen (mechanism), before copying, or by using n bytes copy functions, like strncpy
