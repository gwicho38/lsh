I came across your profile today and think you are a great candidate for the Cloud Cybersecurity – SRE Federal opportunity at C3 AI ([https://c3.ai/job-description/?gh_jid=6555279002](https://c3.ai/job-description/?gh_jid=6555279002 "https://c3.ai/job-description/?gh_jid=6555279002")). 

We're building an engineering team in the SF and DC areas to deliver C3 AI solutions to our Federal customers. In case you've never heard of C3 AI, we're a Silicon Valley-based software company, founded by Tom Siebel, that provides a Platform-as-a-Service on which our customers (primarily Fortune 100 companies) build industrial machine learning applications - think Predictive Maintenance, Network Optimization, Fraud Detection, Sensor Health, and more.

The federal team is responsible for working directly with customers to design, develop, deploy, and operate AI/ML applications on the C3 Platform ([https://c3.ai/blog/software-engineering-roles-changing-with-the-digital-age/).](https://c3.ai/blog/software-engineering-roles-changing-with-the-digital-age/). "https://c3.ai/blog/software-engineering-roles-changing-with-the-digital-age/).") In particular, our Federal team supports programs for the DoD, IC, major defense contractors, and public sector entities (visit [https://c3.ai](https://c3.ai/ "https://c3.ai") for more info). If what we're doing at C3 AI sounds interesting, I'd love to talk with you about our company and the Federal team.

Thanks,  
Mason
