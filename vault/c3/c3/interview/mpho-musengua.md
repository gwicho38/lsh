The candidate will expect a teams call for this interview.

There will be a Teams link, but you may call the candidate on their phone from within the Teams meeting if they are late or having issues logging onto Teams (from the participants pane as shown below):

The main goal is to weed out the B & C players from the candidate pool. We achieve this with 3 primary criteria to look out for:

1. The candidate is aligned with C3 AI culture and values
    
2. The candidate is aligned with the SE job requirements
    
3. Initial screen to make sure the candidate is a strong communicator to move forward with the interview process
    

Finally, the informational screen is an opportunity for us to sell the SE role to the candidate. Since this is typically the first phase of the interview process, this call can go a long way towards getting the candidate excited about the position.

During the interview, remember ‚ÄúGetting curious: What, How, Tell me more.‚Äù The section below is an outline of the major topics that could be covered during an informational screen call.

### How would you describe C3‚Äôs product or what we do?

- Did they research the company beforehand? Good candidates should have.
    
- Are they familiar with the market and relevant technologies?
    
- This is a good time to sell them on C3 as a company.
    
### Tell me about your favorite or most challenging work assignment.

- Can they articulate at a high level the purpose of their project?
    
- Can they describe at a detailed level what their contribution was? Were they actually writing code or just a bystander? Do they specify certain languages/technologies or just speak in buzzwords?
