```
Given a nonnegative integer n where n >=1, determine what the minimum number of perfect squares needed to sum up to n (repeats allowed)


Example:

n = 4, return value = 1 (since 4 is a perfect square, the only perfect square needed to sum up to n is itself)

n = 10, return value = 2 (since we can add 9 + 1 together)

n = 12, return value = 3 (4 + 4 + 4)
```

```
test:

Given a nonnegative integer n where n >=1, determine what the minimum number of perfect squares needed to sum up to n (repeats allowed).

def numSquares(n):
	pass

# Test cases
print(numSquares(4))  # Output: 1
print(numSquares(10)) # Output: 2
print(numSquares(12)) # Output: 3
