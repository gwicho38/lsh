## Question(s) asked:

Status codes. 

## Evaluation

Numerical scores correspond to the following qualitative assessments:

( 1 - Very Poor, 2 - Poor, 3 - Fair, 4 - Good, 5 - Excellent )

Area: Problem Definition/Comprehension

Score: (1-5): 3

Justification: Jay clearly understood the problem. He could have taken more time to flesh out assumptions. Nerves likely contributed to the brief nature of his questioning. 

---

Area: Coding Proficiency/Robustness

Score: (1-5): 4

Justification: Jay solved the problem with only small errors. He solved the problem with a 2nd order solution. 

---

## Code

```md


arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3]
k = 4

from collections import Counter
def sum_of_distinct_numbers(arr, k):
  sum = 0

  if not arr and len(arr) == 0:
    return sum

  for i in range(len(arr) - k + 1):
    window = arr[i:i+k]

    disct_window_len = len(dict(Counter(window)))
    sum += disct_window_len
    print(disct_window_len)
  
  return sum


# def sum_of_distinct_numbers(arr, k):
#   sum = 0

#   if not arr and len(arr) == 0:
#     return sum

#   for i in range(len(arr) - k + 1):
#     window = arr[i:i+k]
#     temp = set()
#     for each in window:
#       temp.add(each)

#     sum += len(temp)
#     print(len(temp))
  
#   return sum```
