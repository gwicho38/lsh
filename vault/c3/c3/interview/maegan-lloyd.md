# Notes

```


-     
    Typical Agenda

-   Personal Introductions from C3 AI team members


-   Personal Introduction from the BAH candidate
-   Discussion questions from the C3 AI team members directed towards the BAH candidate about their recent technical work experiences to determine suitability for C3 AI project work
-   Technical questions from the C3 AI team members directed towards the BAH candidate to understand how the candidate thinks about solving problems

-   Expect a problem to be presented in the meeting‚Äôs chat and be ready to discuss how this problem can be solved using data structures, algorithms, etc.
-   If the BAH candidate would like a collaborative coding environment to type out some code, our team can quickly provide a link to one. We would love to collaborate in this way if you are interested! However, it is not required.

-   [Optional] Discussion questions¬†**from the BAH**¬†**candidate**¬†directed towards the C3 AI team members in order to shed light on topics such as the tech stack we, how the team operates, or anything the candidate is interested in.

-   C3 AI team members

-   There will be 2 C3 AI Solution Engineers on the screen who either work on projects that BAH and C3 AI will collaborate together on or senior level engineers who have worked across a wide variety of C3 AI projects

## Code

```ts

[4, 6, 5, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1]

Integers that represent the heights of buildings,¬†return the count of buildings that have an ‚Äúocean view‚Äù from the top floor.¬†

The ocean is off to the right of the buildings.

Example Input: [4, 6, 5, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1] <‚Äî Ocean over here

Output: 




```

```python

# Given an array of N non-negative integers arr[] representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

# Input: arr[] = [3, 0, 2, 0, 4]

# Python3 implementation of the approach
  
# Function to return the maximum
# water that can be stored
def maxWater(arr, n):
  
    # To store the maximum water
    # that can be stored
    res = 0
  
    # For every element of the array
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
  
        # Find the maximum element on its left
        left = arr[i]
        for j in range(i):
            left = max(left, arr[j])
  
        # Find the maximum element on its right
        right = arr[i]
  
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            right = max(right, arr[j])
  
        # Update the maximum water
        res = res + (min(left, right) - arr[i])
  
    return res
  
  
# Driver code
if __name__ == "__main__":
  
    arr = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0,
           1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
    n = len(arr)
  
    print(maxWater(arr, n))

```

```

array = [4,6,5,3,4,2,3,1]
i = 0
left = 0 right =1
temp = []
while (i < array.length){
  if (array[i] > array[i+1]){
        add array[i] to temp
    if (array[left] < array[i]){
        eg if there's a new tallest building
      left = i
    }
  }
}
