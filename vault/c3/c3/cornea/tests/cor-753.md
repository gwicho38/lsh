Seventeen Nanchang A-5/Q-5 Fantan ground attack aircraft were also present on the northwest Longtien apron without APU carts near the twin-tail aircraft. Additionally, two Changhe Z-8 or Changhe Z-18 heavy lift helicopters and three Harbin Z-9 Haitun medium lift helicopters were located on the Longtien helicopter apron approximately 500 yards to the north of the fixed-wing aircraft. No aircraft were visible inside of revetments at Longtien, and no activity was visible near known munitions stores. The assessment suggests limited readiness levels as of 1342Z 28 July 2023, as indicated by limited starter cart activity and no visible munitions, dispersal efforts, or basing in revetments.","engineLog":"[{\"api\": \"gets\", \"time\": \"2024-02-07T17:47:27.000Z..2024-02-12T17:47:27.000Z\", \"location\": \"Longtien$\", \"link\": \"https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/searchui/search.html?q=Longtien$\", \"lat1\": 24.9445566, \"lat2\": 24.9446566, \"lon1\": 121.4034245, \"lon2\": 121.4035245, \"distance\": \"200 miles\", \"lat_radius\": 2.891390642545228, \"lon_radius\": 3.188857840693184, \"params\": {\"mincolldate\": \"2024-02-07T17:47:27.000Z..2024-02-12T17:47:27.000Z\", \"declat\": \"22.05316595745477..27.836047242545227\", \"declon\": \"118.21456665930681..124.59238234069319\"}, \"request_params\": {\"headers\": {}, \"verify\": false, \"params\": {\"mincolldate\": \"2024-02-07T17:47:27.000Z..2024-02-12T17:47:27.000Z\", \"declat\": \"22.05316595745477..27.836047242545227\", \"declon\": \"118.21456665930681..124.59238234069319\"}}, \"report_information\": [{\"reporttitle\": \"(MOCK S//NF) ROUTINE AIR TRAINING SORTIES OBSERVED AT LONGTIEN ON 16 JULY.\", \"docid\": \"987654321abc\", \"mincolldate\": \"2024-02-12 02:01:25.830481+00:00\", \"classification\": \"SECRET//NOFORN\", \"url\": \"https://example.com/987654321abc\", \"score\": 0.07419239439859097}, {\"reporttitle\": \"(MOCK S//NF) NOTED ACTIVITY AT LONGTIEN.\", \"docid\": \"0148242e2d2e7fb5a8f88dedee651736\", \"mincolldate\": \"2024-02-11 03:19:26.830247+00:00\", \"classification\": \"SECRET//NOFORN\", \"url\": \"https://example.com/0148242e2d2e7fb5a8f88dedee651736\", \"score\": 0.07291177513393525}]}]","statusHistory":[{"timestamp":"2024-02-12T17:47:25Z","parent":{"id":"f3e98b0b-ae6c-4b64-b084-17874d6c6ad2"},"status":"ProcessQuery","id":"f3e98b0b-ae6c-4b64-b084-17874d6c6ad2-ProcessQuery-0","meta":{"fetchInclude":"[status,statusParent,id,timestamp,parent,version]","fetchType":"Genai.Query.Result.InterimStatusHistory"},"version":1},{"timestamp":"2024-02-12T17:47:47Z","parent":{"id":"f3e98b0b-ae6c-4b64-b084-17874d6c6ad2"},"status":"GenerateAnswer","id":"f3e98b0b-ae6c-4b64-b084-17874d6c6ad2-GenerateAnswer-1","meta":{"fetchInclude":"[status,statusParent,id,timestamp,parent,version]","fetchType":"Genai.Query.Result.InterimStatusHistory"},"version":1},{"timestamp":"2024-02-12T17:47:47Z","parent":{"id":"f3e98b0b-ae6c-4b64-b084-17874d6c6ad2"},"status":"Completed","id":"f3e98b0b-ae6c-4b64-b084-17874d6c6ad2-Completed-2","meta":{"fetchInclude":"[status,statusParent,id,timestamp,parent,version]","fetchType":"Genai.Query.Result.InterimStatusHistory"},"version":1}]}

(S//NF) On July 16, 2021, Longtien Airbase in China conducted routine air sortie training, which included 8 JH-7 fighter-bombers and 4 J-10 multi-role fighters conducting local training sorties within 50nm of base, as well as 5 Z-9 and 2 Z-8 helicopters executing routine navigation and maneuver training in the vicinity of Longtien throughout the period. No large formations, prolonged flight operations, or other unusual activities were noted, and this activity closely matches typical sortie generation for basic pilot readiness. No indication of elevated readiness levels or preparation for large-scale operations was evident based on the routine nature of the observed flight activity.
