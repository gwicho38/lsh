# {@jira} cor-7 | Geospatial Payloads

## Description

Description: Enhance the system's response generation capabilities by incorporating geospatial payloads, enabling the inclusion of location-specific information and polygon boundaries in generated responses.

As a user, I need the system to present georectified information, including polygon boundaries and relevant metadata, in a structured format that is easy for me to understand and work with.

Acceptance Criteria:

Geospatial payloads should include accurately georectified data, such as polygon boundaries and associated metadata.

The presented information should be presented in a clear and easily interpretable manner for users.

## NOTES

<!-- Incoporate MapBox into application. -->
