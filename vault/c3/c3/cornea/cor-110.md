[Datasets Covered: {1, 2, 3}]

[Data Source --> Geospatial Sensor Data]

> Pattern:

  [s in S collect data and persist in Geospatial database]

  [q against GeosDB and ingest data through C3 ingestion pipeline]

> Architecture:

  >> Define base Track type and extend per idiosyncratic patterns.

[Environmental -> Track]

[Ingest Patterns]:

  > data at rest

  > periodic pull

  > periodic push

  > publish-subscribe
