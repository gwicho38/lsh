@Feneel --> one of the contractors isn't progressing fast enough.

@Paradyme --> 

@Jeff --> handling --> 

@Brian --> 

---

@alejandro --> conversation --> helping out with SOCOM --> incorporate GenAi. Find data science value. Currently @jeff is the lead --> comfort level. Not really. 

When @Zoe left the company -- and a lot more meetings got added to my calendar. What helped is that I had context before I became lead. I've had 1.5 months of experience before @ICM. 

Find @SOCOM boring -- use case -- @SOCOM is biggest app in Commander's dashboard --> want to start working on base commander dashboard. Prefer customer apps over base applications. Thinking about the customer, pain points, and create new solutions. 

As short term.
