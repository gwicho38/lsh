Peter continues to exceed expectations as an associate engineer, so his promotion to Solution Engineer is both well-deserved and expected. Over the first half of the fiscal year, Peter has jumped from project to project to support whichever pilot needs him most. Whether TRANSCOM, CDAO Presidential Drawdown, or DCSA, Peter has jumped in head first and made an immediate impact to each project. I am excited to see him grow over the coming months from a strong individual contributor into a project lead.

As Peter continues his career at C3, he should focus on the following areas to grow as an engineer:

1. Learn how to be a project lead. Peter has become a Swiss army knife that we are able to use for all varieties of pilots and CoEs. His technical skillset, work ethic, and positive attitude make it easy for him to onboard to a project quickly and contribute immediately. However, to take the next step at C3 Peter needs experience leading projects. He will get that experience as he begins to lead DCSA, and I'm excited to see how he grows in the role.
2. While (previously) only an associate, Peter is on track to be a great people manager at C3 if he so chooses. He has strong interpersonal skills and clearly cares for others. To that end, Peter should find opportunities to mentor others, both in the projects he leads and in the broader engineering team.
3. Peter should continue to learn about cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes through his work on DCSA and work on the suite case. Peter is both interested and talented, and he should continue to pursue these skillsets while also improving his software engineering skills.
