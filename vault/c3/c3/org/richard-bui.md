I joined the company at the end of January this year (so a little over 8 months now) and so far everything has been great! I started off my app rotation on NYPA which is a commercial COE, and then after two weeks hopped onto Property Appraisal (with Joffin & Anthony). 

I stayed on Property Appraisal for about 6 months during the entire pilot process for both Riverside and Stark. I just recently rotated onto SOCOM 2 weeks ago and have been working on that since. At this point, I feel pretty comfortable with front-end, back-end, and the data-ingestion pipeline. I was also to get familiarized with a little bit of data modeling and database design. Right now, I am interested in further expanding my developer skills and learning how to gravitate towards scalable design (like using TimedDataHeader and TimedDataPoint to reduce the amount of rows being read when fetching)

Coming up on a year. 

He's where he's supposed to be. 

NIPA (commercial CoE). Moved to property appraisal since then. Working on the `Stark` pilot with Joffin and Anothony. Since moving to `SoCOM` - Patrick is trying to give more Data Integration and back end tickets. 

`He'll be on SoCOM for a while.`
