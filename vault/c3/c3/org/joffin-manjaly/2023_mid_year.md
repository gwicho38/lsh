Joffin's review:

Over the past 6 months, Joffin has continued to exceed the already high expectations C3 has placed upon him. Joffin has grown from an individual contributor on the Property Appraisal pilots to becoming the SME of the Property Appraisal applications, leading multiple pilots simultaneously. I am impressed with how he has grown since joining C3 just over one year ago, and am excited to watch him become a leader on the federal engineering team.

Over the next fiscal year, I expect to continue to see Joffin's rapid growth as an engineer. Specifically, I expect Joffin to continue to grow in the following ways:

1. Expand his influence beyond the property appraisal team. Joffin has done an incredible job becoming the de facto engineering lead for the entire property appraisal vertical, and has done a tremendous job building relationships there. I would like to see Joffin become more involved in the federal team and cohort meetings to continue his growth as a leader at C3.
2. Begin to mentor others. Joffin is a natural leader and has already begun mentoring others on the Riverside, Stark, and Charlotte Property Appraisal pilots. However, Joffin should work to go out of his way to contribute to the federal team's collective intelligence by hosting office hours, contributing to community, and leading contributing engineers on his team.
3. Go even deeper in the technical weeds. We've given Joffin the opportunity to learn a large breadth of technical and soft skills. However, Joffin should make sure he has the opportunity to solve complicated technical skills and not get stuck in high level project design as the project lead, as he still has plenty of room to grow from a technical perspective.

Thanks for a great first fiscal year Joffin. I am excited to see your continued growth at C3 over the coming fiscal year.
