Did Nodal -- since he was working on property appraisal. DM asked for him to lead on the new stuff. 

Hard to gage whether he's hitting all parts of the tech stacks. Good experience interfacing with customer. 

Long-windedness needs to be improved. 

Promotion plan on pace.

Projects I am working on: 

- All Property Appraisal (Riverside, Stark, and Charlotte counties), onboarding a new SE to this, which will be good support.

- Also supporting Apps team with the Base App creation for PA.

- Generally been pretty distant with Fed. 

- Tuesday 5 PM is good. If we need to do next Tuesday (Oct 10th) that can also work, but I just scheduled today to have a meeting sooner rather than later.
