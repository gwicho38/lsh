# Helm Chart for a C3 Server Local Dependencies

[Up](../../README.md)

## Overview

A "local" environment that assumes you're building and running the C3 server on the macOS host while dependent components are running on the K8s cluster (on a Linux VM) via [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac).

## Dependencies

* [c3-persistence](../c3-persistence/README.md)
* [c3-selenium](../c3-selenium/README.md)
